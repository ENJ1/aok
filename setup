## (with pulseaudio you can only run speaker or headphones not both,
## and must manually change between the two)
## THIS MUST BE CONTROLLED MANUALLY BY THE USER
##
## SAVE SETTINGS AFTER UNMUTING HEADPHONES AND SPEAKER
## THIS ALSO CREATES A FILE SO THAT CHANGES ALWAYS PERSIST ACROSS REBOOTS
## SO THIS ONLY NEEDS TO BE RUN ONCE
