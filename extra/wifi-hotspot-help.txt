STUBBY: SECURE DNS
This is especially useful with WiFi Hotspots that spy on and/or control your Internet usage without your permission.

## Installation
sudo pacman -S stubby
sudo stubby
echo "nameserver 127.0.0.1" > /etc/resolv.conf
lsattr /etc/resolv.conf
chattr +i /etc/resolv.conf

## VISIT dnsleaktest.com TO TEST

## IF TRYING TO GET PAST WIFI HOTSPOT LANDING PAGE
chattr -i /etc/resolv.conf
## THEN TRY AGAIN


Descriptions:

/etc/resolv.conf set to: nameserver 127.0.0.1 (yourself)
lsattr to show immutable flag on /etc/resolv.conf
chattr +i /etc/resolv.conf # make immutable (AKA not changeable)

set to immutable to prevent it being overwritten by systemd.
making it immutable also prevents it being overwritten with wifi hotspots' own dns servers, which is good.


IF THE WI-FI HOTSPOT YOU'RE CONNECTING TO HAS A LANDING PAGE:

You must turn immutable off to allow for connection to wifi landing/login pages.

After an Internet connection is established,
then you can go back to using stubby where /etc/resolv.conf is "nameserver 127.0.0.1", and is immutable.





IF YOU CAN'T GET PAST A LANDING PAGE:

Problem:
Sometimes even clicking "I Agree, Connect" on the landing page doesn't work.
i.e. "It looks like I'm getting stuck on the landing page even when I've PASSED login...
for some reason EVERYTHING routes to that landing page and I can't do anything..."

Cause: Unknown.

Workaround:
Login with your smartphone, then change your laptop's mac id to the smartphone's mac id.

Details:
Public wi-fi hotspots keep track of connections by mac id.
For example, resetting a mac address requires logging in again.
Conversely, setting another device to a mac id that's already logged in will bypass the landing page.


example:

smartphone mac id:
1a:2b:3c:4d:5e:6f

laptop mac id:
aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff

## BASH COMMANDS ON LAPTOP

sudo ip link set mlan0 down
sudo ip link set dev mlan0 address 1a:2b:3c:4d:5e:6f
