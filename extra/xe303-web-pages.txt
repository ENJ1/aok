## USB INSTALL NOT WORKING
## A lot of these guides say you can use a USB drive for installation.
## A USB drive may not work. For me, it doesn't.
## The Debian Wiki says "This same sequence of steps using a USB flash drive
## instead of the SD card failed to boot for reasons currently unknown."

## VIDEO DRIVER
## The Debian Wiki recommends xf86-video-armsoc, but I have found this to be
## worse than using xf86-video-fbdev. I have included what I have tested to be
## the best driver and Xorg.conf file.


## FULL ARM MALI GPU SUPPORT, AND WIFI DRIVERS, ETC
## OUTDATED; THE GUIDE DIDN'T WORK FOR ME IN 2019.
## BUT THIS GUIDE AND CODE AND PATCHES COULD HELP SOMEONE GET IT WORKING.
