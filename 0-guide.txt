Arch Linux on the Samsung XE303C12
Advanced Installation Guide

Use a 4 GB or larger SD Card. USB's won't work.

Developer Mode must be enabled already.

1. Download Zip
2. In Chrome OS, move the aok-master folder from the zip to Downloads
3. CTRL+ALT+T for a crosh window, run "shell" for a shell
4. as chronos, run "sudo cp -r ~/Downloads/aok-master/. /usr/local/aok"
5. sudo su
6. cd /usr/local/aok
7. chmod +x *.sh
8. ./1-install.sh
9. Reboot. CTRL-U, Login (User: root, Pass: root), "cd /aok", and run scripts 2 through 8.

To run scripts 2-8:
1. Login as "root", password "root"
2. Type "cd /aok" and press enter
3. Type "ls" and press enter to list the contents of the folder
4. Type "./2-run-on-first-login.sh" and press enter to run the script.
5. Get online by typing "wifi-menu" and pressing enter.
     This will run a program that guides you to connecting to a Wi-Fi network.
     If the Wi-Fi Hotspot has a Landing Page, see the WiFi Hotspot Help file in "extra".
5. Repeat the process for the next scripts

You probably will want to customize 2-root-pre-config.sh with:
  - Your timezone
  - Your locale
  - Your own username
  - Your own hostname
IF YOU MODIFY THE USERNAME, YOU WILL HAVE TO MODIFY IT IN ALL
THE OTHER USER SCRIPTS!!!

You probably REALLY want to run the "patch" scripts!!!
The patch scripts get Arch Linux working nicely on the XE303C12.
Everything else is just normal Arch Linux install stuff.
