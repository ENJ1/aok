Developer Mode must be enabled already.

1. Download Zip
2. In Chrome OS, move the aok-master folder from the zip to Downloads
3. CTRL+ALT+T for a crosh window, run "shell" for a shell
4. as chronos, run "sudo cp -r ~/Downloads/aok-master/. /usr/local/aok"
5. sudo su
6. cd /usr/local/aok
7. chmod +x *.sh
8. ./1-install.sh
9. Reboot. CTRL-U, Login (User: root, Pass: root), "cd /aok", and run scripts.

To run scripts after install:
1. Login as "root", password "root"
2. Type "cd /aok" and press enter
3. Type "ls" and press enter to list the contents of the folder
4. Type "./2-run-on-first-login.sh" and press enter to run the script.
5. Get online by typing "wifi-menu" and pressing enter.
     This will run a program that guides you to connecting to a Wi-Fi network.
     If the Wi-Fi Hotspot has a Landing Page, see the WiFi Hotspot Help file in "extra".
     Once the system is installed, Landing Pages will work automatically and a browser
     will be installed so you can visit the Landing Page and get online.
5. Repeat the process for the next script, using that script name

You may want to customize script 2 with:
  - Your locale
  - Your own username
  - Your own hostname
IF YOU MODIFY THE USERNAME, YOU WILL HAVE TO MODIFY THE OTHER SCRIPT TO MATCH IT!!!

You probably REALLY want to run the "patch" stuff!!!
The patch code get Arch Linux working nicely on the XE303C12.
Everything else is just normal Arch Linux install stuff.
