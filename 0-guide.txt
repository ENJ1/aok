Arch Linux on the Samsung XE303C12 and HP Chromebook 11
Advanced Installation Guide

Use a 4 GB or larger SD Card. USB's won't work.

1. In Chrome OS, move the aok folder from the zip to Downloads
2. CTRL+ALT+T for a crosh window, run "shell" for a shell
3. as chronos, run "cp -r ~/Downloads/aok /usr/local"
4. sudo su
5. cd /usr/local/aok
6. ./1-install.sh
7. Reboot. CTRL-U, Login (User: root, Pass: root), "cd /aok", and run scripts 2 through 8.


Run "root" scripts as root. These provide setup for all users.
Run "user" scripts as a user. These provide an environment, and user-specific settings.

You probably will want to customize 2-root-pre-config.sh with:
  - Your timezone
  - Your locale
  - Your own username
  - Your own hostname
IF YOU MODIFY THE USERNAME, YOU WILL HAVE TO MODIFY IT IN ALL
THE OTHER USER SCRIPTS!!!

You probably REALLY want to run the "patch" scripts!!!
The patch scripts get Arch Linux working nicely on the XE303C12.
Everything else is just normal Arch Linux install stuff.
